The Code is written without the use of any libraries, so please use the maximum possible output screen
Preferably, use IDLE, or Python GUI directly in the fullscreen. The text are made to fit on a full screen.

And the main code, is inside the Code Folder, named "FILE TO RUN",rest are the modules, that i've imported 
and used inside the main code.
